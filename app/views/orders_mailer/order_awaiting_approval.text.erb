An Order Awaits Your Approval

A member of one of the agencies you advise, <%= @order.owner.name unless @order.owner.nil? %>, has created an order on CreativeQ. Before a Designer can pick up the order and get to work, you'll have to approve it.

Please take time to login and approve the order as soon as possible so the designers can get started. If an order remains unapproved two weeks before the deadline, it might not be completed on time.

If you have any questions, feel free to contact the web folks at OSI Design Group.
