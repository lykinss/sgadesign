Hello there.

This directory (/var/www/sgadesign-app) holds the application files for SGA's
copy of CreativeQ. I suggest that you do not attempt to modify files within
this directory, as there is no recourse. Whereas CreativeQ can be redeployed
somewhat easily from its Git repository, there is no repository backing this
application.

SGA's DesignQ does not get any updates, as does CreativeQ. If there are any
major issues with its use, please contact aj.foster@knights.ucf.edu.
